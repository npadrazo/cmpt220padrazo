Nicole,

- Good job in creating your accounts!

- Good job in setting up your java compiler in your system.

- Good job with your first GitHub submission!

- Good organization of your repository! :)

However,

- You were asked to name your .pdf file hw0lastname.pdf where "lastname" is
  your last name, but you did not follow instructions.

- Please be careful in following instructions in the future.


Peace,

- Dr. Pablo Rivas
